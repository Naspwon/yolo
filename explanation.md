YOLO Application Containerization with Docker

Overview 
This project demonstrates the containerization of an e-commerce web application using Docker and Docker Compose. The backend connects to a MongoDB database, and the frontend. The database, backend, and frontend are all run in separate containers orchestrated using Docker Compose.

STEPS:
Reverted back to commit (07000b7ad2e30a7fe4f03b3748bd544dcf28cf25). All development work was done on the main branch and merged to master branch.

Requirements 
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine: 
Docker 
Docker-Compose 
Node.js (for local development/testing)

Steps to Run application locally
git clone https://github.com/Naspwon/yolo.git 
cd yolo
Build and run application using docker-compose
docker-compose up --build

Verify docker containers running
docker ps
